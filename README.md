# Bus Mall Focus Group

The Bus Mall Focus Group project was designed to gather consumer input on which products they'd be most willing to purchase. Using JavaScript product images are randomly served to the consumer. Once 25 products have been selected the user is shown the current results of the focus group; results are served up with ChartJS in addition to an aside showing the clicks to views percentage. Participation in the data gathering is designed to only be completed by each person once.
